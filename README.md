This is a bash script created to start at the start of your session in Ubuntu which will update your packages and upgrade them, if necessary and also has one or two other goodies embedded as well :)
Please make sure that the script is added as on of your startup applications. You can find this by going to Unity > typing "startup"
and clicking on Startup Applications. From there, click on "add" and add the following: gnome-terminal --command="path/to/file"
To make sure everything else in the script works as intended, please look at the code and make sure to follow the steps written in the comments.
Have fun!
